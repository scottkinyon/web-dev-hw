## Assignment 10

A system font is one installed on a computer and is often used by installed applications. A web font is one recognized by web-browsers and thus able to be displayed correctly. A web-safe fonts are more generic, widely accepted fonts that can serve as fallback fonts.

Fallback fonts allow a web designer to maintain a consistent and effective aesthetic even if the user's browser or computer lacks the chosen font for a specific element.

For this assignment I created all files and folders first. I then added the 4 meta elements and 4 main document elements to my index.html. I then created divs for each section. Next I found the book I wanted to use and filled in the content. From there I selected colors, downloaded fonts and added the appropriate styling in my style.css and fonts.css style sheets.
