      <p>
        The night before he went to London, <strong>Richard Mayhew</strong> was not enjoying himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had begun the evening by enjoying himself: he had enjoyed reading the good-bye cards, and receiving the hugs from several not entirely unattractive young ladies of his acquaintance; he had enjoyed the warnings about the evils and dangers of London, and the gift of the white umbrella with the map of the <strong><dfn title="London's subway system">London Underground</dfn></strong> on it that his friends had chipped in money to buy; he had enjoyed the first few pints of ale; but then, with each successive pint he found that he was enjoying himself significantly less; until now he was sitting and shivering on the sidewalk outside the pub in a small Scottish town, weighing the relative merits of being sick and not being sick, and not enjoying himself at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the pub, <abbr title="Richard Mayhew">Richard</abbr>'s friends continued to celebrate his forthcoming departure with an enthusiasm that, to <abbr title="Richard Mayhew">Richard</abbr>, was beginning to border on the sinister. He sat on the sidewalk and held on tightly to the rolled-up umbrella, and wondered whether going south to London was really a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You want to keep a eye out," said a cracked old voice. "They'll be moving you on before you can say <dfn title="A mythical figure commonly used as a figure of speech in the U.K., referring to someone of unusual quickness">Jack Robinson</dfn>. Or taking you in, I wouldn't be surprised." Two sharp eyes stared out from a beaky, grimy face. "You all right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, thank you," said <abbr title="Richard Mayhew">Richard</abbr>. He was a fresh-faced, boyish young man, with dark, slightly curly hair and large hazel eyes; he had a rumpled, just-woken-up look to him, which made him more attractive to the opposite sex than he would ever understand or believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The grimy face softened. "Here, poor thing," she said, and pushed a <dfn title="About 64 U.S. cents">fifty-pence</dfn> piece into <abbr title="Richard Mayhew">Richard</abbr>'s hand. " 'Ow long you been on the streets, then?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm not homeless," explained <abbr title="Richard Mayhew">Richard</abbr>, embarrassed, attempting to give the old woman her coin back. "Pleaseâ€”take your money. I'm fine. I just came out here to get some air. I go to London tomorrow."
      </p>
      <p>
        She peered down at him suspiciously, then took back her fifty pence and made it vanish beneath the layers of coats and shawls in which she was enveloped. "I've been to London," she confided. "I was married in London. But he was a bad lot. Me mam told me not to go marrying outside, but I was young and beautiful, although you'd never credit it today, and I followed my heart."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm sure you did," said <abbr title="Richard Mayhew">Richard</abbr>. The conviction that he was about to be sick was starting, slowly, to fade.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Fat lot of good it done me. I been homeless, so I know what it's like," said the old woman. "That's why I thought you was. What you going to London for?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've got a job," he told her proudly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Doing what?" she asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Um, <dfn title="A dreadfully boring and terrifyingly influential financial profession">Securities</dfn>," said <abbr title="Richard Mayhew">Richard</abbr>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I was a dancer," said the old woman, and she tottered awkwardly around the sidewalk, humming tunelessly to herself. Then she teetered from side to side like a spinning top coming to rest, and finally she stopped, facing <abbr title="Richard Mayhew">Richard</abbr>. "Hold out your hand," she told him, "and I'll tell yer fortune."
