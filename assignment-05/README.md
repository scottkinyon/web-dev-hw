# Assignment 5
## Scott Kinyon

Each page in html should contain one <head> and one <body>. The <head> element will contain meta data and information about the pages such as its title and provides content primarily to web browsers and search engines. The <body> element will contain most of the page's content with which the use will interact. In addition to providing content, the <body> element also dictates the basic structure of the page.

Structural markup delineates the basic layout, hierarchy, and structure of the page. This includes paragraphs, headings, lists, and breaks. Semantic markup assigns various meanings to different content. This includes strengthening or emphasizing certain text, defining content, denoting quotations and citations, labelling addresses, etc.

My workflow has begun to develop a pattern. I start out by opening Atom and creating all the files (with appropriate extensions) and folders needed for the assignment. I then review my previous week's files as a quick refresher of proper formatting. I then begin by creating the essential tags such as <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, <body>, etc. Once I have filled my files with content and ensured they are coded correctly, I close Atom and open GitHub Desktop. Using GitHub Desktop I retrieve my origin, commit the changes to my repository, then go to GitHub, get the links and post them to Moodle.
