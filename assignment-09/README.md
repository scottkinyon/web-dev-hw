## Assignment 9

Universal, element, class, and id selector types are hierarchical levels of selectors in CSS. the universal selector is the quickest way to apply one style setting to all parts of the page. The element selector allows you to, for example, change all of the h1 tags to a certain color. The class selector will apply styles to any elements which you have labelled with the same class name, which might be useful if you have several sections to which you'd like to apply the same style. The id selector type allows for selecting and assigning a style to one specific tag that you identify by name. The more specific levels of selectors will override more general selectors. Thus you may apply the same color to all p elements, but specify specific paragraphs you'd like to call out.

The three colors I chose to represent the 60s were inspired by the following website:

The site lists six colors for each decade. The rgb values of the colors I chose do not match the ones mentioned in the website directly, but they were pulled from pictures I found that I tried to match to the original colors. The values are as follows:

Avocado: 183,195,39
Harvest Gold: 225,166,30
Teak: 53,37,32

For this assignment's work cycle I first created the folders needed and the blank .md .html and .css files. I then added the four main document elements and four meta elements to the index.html. Next I created the divs for one main heading, 3 photos and their headings, and one subheading. Once I had the basic layout written out I searched online for some color schemes. Once I chose my color scheme I then went to Pinterest to find photos that captured the colors I chose. I opened the photos in Photoshop, cropped them, and used the color picker tool to pull out the rgb values from selected points in each photo. These are the colors I used throughout my .css file.  I next added the content into my .html file and lastly applied various styles through .css.
