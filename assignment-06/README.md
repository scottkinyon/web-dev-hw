# Assignment 6
## Scott Kinyon

I've come across many types of forms on the web. The search and login forms are perhaps the most common, but many others exist. These include surveys, settings (for web apps, etc.), electronic versions of traditional paper forms (filing taxes, applying for student loans, passport applications, etc.), submitting credit card information for online purchases, booking tickets for events or travel, making dinner reservations, tests and quizzes for online classes, and much more.

A text input might be used for entering your name for a variety of different forms, such as making an online purchase (to accompany your credit card information). A selection input might be used for selecting your type of credit card for the purchase (Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, etc.). A button input might be used to confirm your purchase and/or submit payment.

My work cycle for this assignment was a little different than previous assignments. I still started out by making the appropriate folders and files, but once I began coding my index.html document things took a turn. This time I typed out the head and body tags first and then went back in to add more detail. The form, in particular, I built out piecemeal and found I had to constantly refer back to the course website for direction as there were so many little components to remember.

I also did more proofing this assignment. After pushing my files to Github using Github Desktop, I went to the live site to check it out. After review I fixed the labels tags on the radio selection list and changed the size on the submit button image then pushed the changes to GitHub again.  My changes were still not solving the problem, so I added some comments to the index.html, re-pushed it and also opened an Issue.
