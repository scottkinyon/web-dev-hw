        <em>Roots + Kin Studio</em> was founded in 2019 by artist and consultant <strong>Scott Kinyon</strong>. Scott has an extensive professional, educational and artistic background. Studies in Psychology, Organizational Leadership, Anthropology, Art, and Media Arts have equiped him with an understanding of artistic projects within their human contexts.
