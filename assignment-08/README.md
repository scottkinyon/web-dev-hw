## Assignment 8

Years ago I took part in an html workshop at my local homeschool co-op. That workshop only scratched the surface of what we're doing now. As we move farther along in this course it is becoming very apparent how much quicker it can be to format using html rather than a word processor or drag and drop layout system. Of course, the speed at formatting and creating layouts increases exponentially when you consider sites with hundreds of pages that utilize CSS.  This is why I'm excited to dive into CSS for the next part of this course.

Forms continue to give me trouble.  I think it will help to explore some of the scripts that collect data or interact with the data from forms as this would make the logic and organization of forms more clear.

This project was quite in depth and I did a little extra in some areas. I was growing tired of the end products of previous assignments being so, for lack of a better word, ugly. I played around a little bit in Photoshop to create and edit the images used in this assignment.  Even though the end product is still seriously deficient from an aesthetic standpoint it still felt good to flex my creative muscles and then input the images into the end product.
