      <p>Have you ever arrived at your destination only to realize you forgot that essential something? Are you often frustrated by carrying around a 49.99 lb checked bag and a carry-on and personal item stuffed to bursting? Whether you are a frequent traveller or are setting out on a first adventure, there are some helpful tips to packing just the right amount. Below are some tips for how to streamline your packing while still ensuring you take what you need.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Know Your Destination</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-paragraph">
      <p>The first step to optimizing your travel packing is to study your destination. Take some time to research where you will be going. What is the climate like? What season will it be? Can I expect sunshine, rain, snow, storms, drought? Of course, there is much more to a destination than the weather. Consider also the purpose of your trip, the type of settings where you'll be spending most of your time, who you will be interacting with, and how long you'll be away. Check the list below for tips to consider.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weather</strong> - Study the average temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and variability of the weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Development</strong> - Is this an urban destination or rural? Will you have access to stores to buy essentials or will you need to bring your own? Will you have access to laundry? What is transportation like? Will you be doing a lot of walking?</li>
        <li><strong>Culture</strong> - You might want to think twice about wearing your "I Love Bacon" T-Shirt if travelling to places with high concentrations of halal or kosher observing people. Do you want to wear your U.S. flag T-Shirt in a place that might be opposed to U.S. foreign policy? Are there certain standards of modesty or formality in dress? There is something to be said for expressing and maintaining your individual style, but try to be aware of how your wardrobe might offend the people whose home you are visiting.</li>
        <li><strong>Activities</strong> - Your destination is more than just the city or country to which you'll be travelling. COnsider also what you will be doing there. Are you attending a business conference? You may want to bring more formal wear. Will you be hiking? Bring good shoes! Will you be having picnics? Dress for the outdoors. Will you be dining out?</li>
        <li><strong>Company</strong> - Who you will be spending time with should also factor into what you will pack. If you are meeting people for the first time, consider the type of first impression you'd like to make. If you are meeting old friends or family maybe you can be more relaxed or casual.</li>

      <h2>Step 2: Pick Your Color Palette</h2>
    </div>

    <br />

    <br />

    <div class="body-paragraph">
      <p>Have you ever been on a trip and found that you brought your favorite shirt, but it doesn't match anything else you brought? Or maybe you had outfits planned for each day, but then you spill spaghetti sauce on your pants and the only pants you have to change into don't match what you're wearing. Rather than planning an outfit for each day, try to <strong>select a color palette for this trip</strong> and make sure your clothes and accessories all fit within this palette. That way you can mix and match at will. Activities may change and weather can be unpredictable so it's best to have a wardrobe that doesn't clash so it can accomodated these changes.</p>
      <p>If you already have a color palette in your closet at home this will help, but if you need some direction consider color theory. Maybe you want to go with an <em>analogous color palette</em> or <em>split complimentary</em>. Consult the color theory guide below for inspiration:<p>

      <br />
      <p>Another thing to keep in mind when picking your palette is to refer back to your destination. <em>Be mindful of culturally significant colors</em> or colors specific to an event. Do you want to wear a white dress to someone else's wedding? Is the college town you're visiting playing their rival team, and do you know their colors?</P>

      <h2>Step 3: Multiply to Minimize</h2>
    </div>

    </div>

    <br />

    <div class="body-paragraph">
      <p>This next step is where all your research and planning pay off. Now that you've determined the factors of your destination and chosen a color palette, go through your wardrobe and find the most versatile articles. <em>Think of things that you can dress up or dress down</em>. Find shoes that are comfortable and classy. Can you take off your tie and unbutton your collar after the conference to let that shirt double as your evening wear?</p>
      <p>Your goal should be to bring fewer things by selecting things that can serve multiple uses. Thus, you <em>mulitply to minimize</em>. Not only will planning ahead and travelling light make your trip more effortless, but you will leave room in your luggage for souvenirs to bring back!</p>
