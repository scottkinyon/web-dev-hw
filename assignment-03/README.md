Web browsers interpret code to deliver web content to a user. By utilizing DOM, CSSOM, and other key components, web browsers interpret and deliver the markup and style and of web pages and interpret and run any scripts in order to present the fully functioning web page to the user. For my personal computer I use Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome as my web browsers, while at work I also use Microsoft Edge.

A markup language determines a web page's architecture with an emphasis on text content. Hypertext Markup Language (html) is one of the most commonly used markup languages for web development.
