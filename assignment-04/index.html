  <h1>Sonnet LXIII</h1>
  <h2>Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>Life, were thy pains as are the pains of hell,<br />
    So hardly to be borne, yet to be borne,<br />
    And all thy boughs more grim with wasp and thorn<br />
    Than armoured bough stood ever; too chill to spell<br />
    With the warm tongue, and sharp with broken shell<br />
    Thy ways, whereby in wincing haste forlorn<br />
    The desperate foot must travel, blind and torn,<br />
    Yet must I cry: So be it; it is well.<br />
    So fair to me thy vineyards, nor less fair<br />
    Than the sweet heaven my fathers hoped to gain;<br />
    So bright this earthly blossom spiked with care,<br />
    This harvest hung behind the boughs of pain,<br />
    Needs must I gather, guessing by the stain<br />
    I bleed, but know not wherefore, know not where.<br /></p>
