## Assignment 12

For this assignment, my imaginary client was myself and the business was a graphic design/content curation business. I wanted a site that demonstrated a simple, consistent aesthetic using hero images and subtly responsive elements.

display:block allows a web developer to direct elements to be displayed below the previous element in its own horizontal block. display:inline forces elements to occupy only as much horizontal space as they need and makes elements horizontally adjacent to one another. display:inline-block behaves much like display:inline, except that elements must respect margins and vertical spacing properties.

For this assignment I first created all files and folders I would need and then began filling out each page with structure and content. Like in previous assignments I built out the 4 main elements first and then added content. My color choices were driven by the placeholder images I found. One thing different about this assignment, since I wanted a similar structural layout for all four pages I did a lot of copying and pasting from the index.html to the other pages. I had to take care to changes specific things that were unique to each page, specifically the element ids.
